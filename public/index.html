    <h1>Victor Li</h1>
    <p>I am an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto studying Biochemistry and Computer Science.
      Currently working on elucidating iPSC reprogramming trajectories under Dr. Jeffrey Wrana.

      Some of my interests:
      - Biotechnology (esp. longevity-related research and interventions)
      - Philosophy (esp. in the analytic tradition)
      - 
      - The long-term future of humanity

      Some of my core beliefs:
      - Dare to want things unapologetically
      - Be an active participant in reality
      - All shortcomings are skill issues
      - You only lose when you decide you've lost
